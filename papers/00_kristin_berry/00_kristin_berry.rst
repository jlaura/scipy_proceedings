A Super Cool Title
------------------------------------------------

.. class:: abstract

   Write me last.

.. class:: keywords

   keyword1, keyword2, etc.

Introduction
------------

This is background information.  What is the problem? (Multi-view correspondence for sparse reconstruction.)  What has been done already?  

Then, what is the motivation behind what we are doing?  This can be a broad description of the pipeline approach from raw imagery to more controlled data.  You can talk about terrestrial satellite positioning information (very good) and planetary positioning information (can be quite poor).  Why do we need to improve it and what step in the process does this tool seek to improve. 

* I would not focus heavily on ISIS (the methods are quite out of date and short on literature review).


Planetary Data
--------------

Here describe the data that we have.  What are the issues?  (Homogeneity, viewing geometry, data volumes that are hard to reduce because all data is precious, etc.)  What 'good' stuff do we have going on?

What is AutoCnet
----------------
Here you can offer a really broad description of AutoCnet.  The above is very general.  Here you get to include more detail.

AutoCnet's Architecture
-----------------------
This is the graph stuff. The outlier detection, the fundamental matrix.  The why those items are tagged to different architecture components.  What does that facilitate?  I can help with the implementation details / equations for any of this.

Case Study: Apollo 15
---------------------
We can process a few dozen Apollo 15 images and get a figure or two here.  We can task one of the students to do this (and make sure we include a thank you at the conclusion of this article).

Future Work
-----------
What comes next?  MLE for projective matrices, HPC deployment, Tri and n-focal tensors to improve accuracy, scale and rotation invariant sub pixel accuracy checks, etc.
